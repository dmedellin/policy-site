<h1>Data Deletion</h1>
<p>If you want us to delete operational data we control (e.g., access tokens, logs, post IDs), follow one of these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Remove the App</strong> from your Facebook settings. Meta may send us an automated deletion request, which we honor.</li>
  <li><strong>Email request:</strong> send a message to <a href="mailto:davidjmedellin@gmail.com">davidjmedellin@gmail.com</a> with subject “Data Deletion Request”. Include:
    <ul>
      <li>Your Page ID or link</li>
      <li>Approximate dates of activity</li>
      <li>What you want deleted (tokens/logs/posts created by the App)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We will confirm receipt and delete eligible data within a reasonable timeframe unless retention is required by law or to resolve security incidents.</p>
